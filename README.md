# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

This project consolidates information and images about Mars from several websites into a single webpage using web scraping. After the information is scraped, it is stored in MongoDB, and Flask and Bootstrap are used to create a webpage. This page can be updated with the latest news and images from the source websites every time a user scrapes new data.
